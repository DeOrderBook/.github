Welcome to DeOrderBook â€” a breakthrough protocol designed for the creation, exchange, and exercise of trustless option-like instruments, without reliance on oracles. By addressing prevalent capital inefficiencies in DeFi, especially for Bitcoin options, we offer real yield and eliminate the need for trusted intermediaries, establishing DeOrderBook as the first truly trustless and risk-bound platform for on-chain options ever.

## Unique Protocol Features
- **Immediate Monetisation & Real Yield**: Our core token, $DOB, is fully embedded into the mechanism design to offer an avenue to automated liquidity and immediate monetisation for writers of option-like instruments. Writers of option-like instruments sell into an Option Pool and receive pro-rata $DOB every block which represents a continuous stream of premium during the life of the option. Conversely, buyers of option-like instruments may stake (with a time-based withdrawal cooldown or "lock") their $DOB in the special staking pool to receive a pro-rata share of the exercise rights to all the Option Pool entered into on the last day. Locking of $DOB also results in earning a portion of the fees collected by the protocol in hard tokens (i.e. bitcoins and stablecoins). Given $DOB's utility in unlocking access to valuable option rights and hard token fees, it is expected to have value as long as there is activity in the protocol, therefore making DeOrderBook a "real yield" protocol. 
- **Dual-Token Architecture & Capital Efficiency**: Each option-like instrument is represented by a pair of tokens, separating tokenised option obligations (provided to writers) from tokenised option rights (auctioned daily to $DOB stakers). By combining both tokens, option writers have the novel possibility of unwinding their options early, unlocking their capital to use elsewhere. This unique feature is not goes beyond traditional "hedging", and is unique to DeOrderBook's novel design. 
- **100% DeFi & Risk Bound**: Proudly fully non-custodial, DeOrderBook removes credit and settlement risks with its fully collateralised approach. Without reliance on oracles or other single points-of-failure, we eliminate boundless risks, making DeOrderBook a risk-bound solution unlike anything else both on-chain and off-chain. We believe the innovation of DeOrderBook in the on-chain derivatives sector will be analogous to the impact of Uniswap in the on-chain spot sector.
