Welcome to DeOrderBook â€” a cutting-edge, trustless optionality protocol designed to address the capital inefficiencies prevalent in the DeFi landscape, particularly for the Bitcoin options market. With our innovative design, we offer real yield and entirely remove the need for oracles, making DeOrderBook a truly trustless and efficient solution for DeFi optionality.

## Product Features
- **Fully Decentralised Optionality**: Besides being non-custodial, DeOrderBook removes the need for oracles in its design, providing a truly trustless environment.
- **$DOB: Utility with Real Yield**: Our embedded utility $DOB has natural mechanisms for demand and supply yet at its core can be locked for hard rewards in the form of $bHODL (wrapped-bitcoin) and $uHODL (wrapped-dollar) tokens.
- **Unmatched Capital Flexibility**: Our dual-token option model is designed to solve capital inefficiencies in this vertical, allowing for the early unwind of collateral.
